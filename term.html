<h2>JasminChat Pro's Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
    The Privacy Policy("Policy")was written in English (US) and will be the agreement between You and JasminChat Pro while you are using JasminChat Pro's applications ("APP"). To the extent any translated version of this Policy conflicts against the English version, this English version prevails.</p>

<p>Date of Last Revision: Nov 24, 2010</p>

<h2>The Summary</h2>

<p>
    If you visit here from <a href="http://policy.JasminChat 改Pro.in/terms.html">Terms and Conditions of Use draft by JasminChat Pro</a>. You should read this privacy
    policy because it will tell you exactly how your personal data is being looked after by
    JasminChat Pro and it is very important for you to know. Here are the topics that we cover:
</p>

<p> 1. What information we collect and how we collect it.</p>

<p> 2. How we use the information and who we share it with.</p>

<p> 3. How you can access and update such information.</p>

<p> 4. How we protect the information we store about you.</p>

<h2>The full legal bit</h2>

<p>
    We know that other people’s use of your personal data is a big concern for social network users, so we at JasminChat Pro have
    developed this privacy policy (the "Policy") to let you know how we use personal information ('personal data' or
    'personal information').
</p>

<p>
    Our Policy applies to your use of the JasminChat Pro website at www.JasminChat改 Pro.in (“Jasmin” or the “site” which includes APP). We suggest you read it in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms”). When you
    access or use JasminChat Pro, you agree to our Privacy Policy and you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure
    of your personal information as we’ve set out in this Policy.
</p>

<p>
    JasminChat Pro reserves the right to change this Policy at any time and without notice, so be sure to check this Policy
    regularly to understand how we use your information.
</p>

<p>
    By installing, using, registering to or otherwise accessing the services, you agree to this privacy policy and give an explicit and informed consent to the processing of your personal data in accordance with this privacy policy. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE.
</p>

<h2>1. JasminChat Pro user's information</h2>

<p>
    To join the JasminChat Pro you will have to complete our online registration form, where we ask you to provide us
    with information about you such as your name, your gender, your date of birth, your location
    details. You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you
    control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your “Profile” page, which
    gives you the chance to correct or update (other than gender) your information at any time by just
    logging in to JasminChat Pro.
</p>

<h3>
    What information does JasminChat Pro collect
</h3>

<p>
    Once you have created a Profile, we will automatically track certain information such as your IP, device
    locale, timezone. And we also collect infomation about WiFi access points as well as other location information
    about your longitude and latitude. That information helps us identify your physical location so that it can be
    displayed and shared with other users choosing to view "nearby" users. We may from time to time allow
    our
    employees to use the product for testing and user engagement
    purposes.
</p>

<p>
    For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require users to verify their
    accounts (because we want to make sure you are not a robot!) and might ask for your phone number or Facebook/Google
    Account. Don’t worry! This
    is only to make sure you are real and breathing! We won't use your phone number for marketing purposes.
</p>

<p>
    When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request,
    Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you
    interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may
    also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and
    which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the
    Service.
</p>

<h3>
    How we use your information
</h3>

<p>
    In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information
    that we receive to:

    marketing;</p>

    If I put other information about me on the JasminChat Pro, what does JasminChat Pro do with it?
</h3>

<p>
    JasminChat Pro is designed to make it easy for you to find, connect and interact with other users of JasminChat Pro by posting
    information about yourself. When using the App you should assume that anything you post or submit will be publicly
    viewable and accessible, both by Users of the App and non-Users of the App. For example, to make it easier to find
    other users and connect with them, we have allowed you to share other users' profiles on Facebook. This
    feature
    can be turned off in your settings at any time. You can also use our instant message function, which allows you
    to communicate with other users. We recommend and encourage you (and all our users) to think carefully about the
    information they disclose about themselves. We also do not
    recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses,
    credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ licence details and other sensitive information in your
    Profile which is open to abuse and misuse.

<h2>
    5. Your rights
</h2>

<p>
    You can review and revise your profile information at any time. Once you register, you will be able to review and
    change much of your personal information except gender. If you want to stop using your account it will be initially
    deactivated. This means that no user will be able to search for you on App although they may still see you
    profile from direct cached links, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information in case you later
    decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us
    to maintain their information until they return to JasminChat Pro. You will therefore be able to restore your account and
    your profile in its entirety within 15 days of de-activating it.
</p>

<p>
    After the expiration of 15 days, your account is permanently deleted from JasminChat Pro. We delete photographs from our
    servers within 7 days from the expiration of the deactivation period while other information (such as contact
    history) is deleted by us over a longer timescale, by way of housekeeping on a periodic basis. You should only
    delete your account if you are certain you never want to restore it.
</p>

<p>
    To prevent abuse and/or misuse of JasminChat Pro by a user following termination or deletion of a profile/account We shall
    retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that user does not open a new
    account and profile in breach of our Terms and Conditions of Use and to ensure compliance with all laws and
    regulations.
